My shitty ahk scripts


Probably qol or scripts for streaming

--------------------------------------
[Counter.ahk](https://github.com/null-zero/AHK-Scripts/blob/master/Counter.ahk) - Simple counter using hotkeys, originally meant to keep track of deaths. Saves to file to be used as an on screen element

[OSRS_Scene_Switcher.ahk](https://github.com/null-zero/AHK-Scripts/blob/master/OSRS_Scene_Switcher.ahk) - Automatically switches scenes when the login button or the bank pin interface is visible in osrs

[Lava_Runner_Overlay.ahk](https://github.com/null-zero/AHK-Scripts/blob/master/Lava_Runner_Overlay.ahk) - On screen visual aid for when to trade binding necklace. Checks for the image of "25" inventory spaces.
