My shitty ahk scripts


Probably qol or scripts for streaming

--------------------------------------
[Counter.ahk](https://github.com/null-zero/AHK-Scripts/blob/master/Counter.ahk) - Simple counter using hotkeys, originally meant to keep track of deaths. Saves to file to be used as an on screen element

[OSRS_Scene_Switcher.ahk](https://github.com/null-zero/AHK-Scripts/blob/master/OSRS_Scene_Switcher.ahk) - Automatically switches scenes when the login button or the bank pin interface is visible in osrs

[Lava_Runner_Overlay.ahk](https://github.com/null-zero/AHK-Scripts/blob/master/Lava_Runner_Overlay.ahk) - On screen visual aid for when to trade binding necklace. Checks for the image of "25" inventory spaces.
<---- Must be on fixed ingame with stretched mode enabled on 1920x1080 screen. ---->

Haven't tested with any other settings. If it doesn't work for you, update the image of the "25" text to what yours looks like. 

  Might revisit this to work no matter the settings, just seems like a lot of work. Unsure if OCR is fast enough to be worth while    using.
